# Workshop Overview

**Welcome to the AI Agent Workshop!**

This workshop uses the `agentic-playground` repository to introduce concepts and practical implementations of AI agents.

**Target Audience:**
This workshop is designed for developers, AI enthusiasts, and technical customers interested in understanding and building AI agents.

**Goal:**
By the end of this workshop, you will:
*   Understand the fundamental concepts of AI agents.
*   Explore various agent patterns (ReAct, Multi-Agent, Human-in-the-Loop).
*   Gain hands-on experience with relevant frameworks and libraries used in the repository (e.g., OpenAI API patterns, LangChain, Semantic Kernel, AutoGen).

**Format:**
The workshop combines presentations, detailed code walkthroughs based on the repository examples, and hands-on exercises to reinforce learning.

**Repository:**
All code examples are sourced from the following GitHub repository:
[https://github.com/denniszielke/agentic-playground](https://github.com/denniszielke/agentic-playground)
We encourage you to explore the repository alongside the workshop materials.

**Workshop Structure:**

*   **Day 1: Foundations:** Basic LLM interaction, handling multimodal inputs (images), and working with complex data structures.
*   **Day 2: Single Agents & Orchestration:** Equipping agents with tools, implementing autonomous agents (ReAct), and incorporating human-in-the-loop workflows.
*   **Day 3: Advanced Multi-Agent Systems:** Designing systems with multiple collaborating agents using structured workflows and dynamic group chats.
